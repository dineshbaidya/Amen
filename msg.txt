Hello,

On Saturday, 3rd June 2023 Webgrity has organized a day out for all our team members at Wet-O-Wild and Nicco Park.

Wet-O-Wild
A Water park inside Nicco Park which includes Thunder Bowl, Tornado Funnel, Crusader Ride, Lazy River Ride, Tube Slide, Rain Dance, Pirate Bay, Wave Runner, Kiddies Pool, Wave Pool, Niagra Fall, Family Swirl Ride, Body slide and many more water based fun activity for people of all ages.

Nicco Park
A park with variety of thrill-seeking rides is built using the latest technology. From adrenaline-pumping rides that are crazy enough to bring alive the child in you to lazy and soothing sojourns that rejuvenate one from within.

Office will take care of the Entry fee for both the parks (including free rides) along with lunch for you and your spouse and kids. You can bring your friends and family members (other than spouse and kids) with you to enjoy this day out at your own expenses which is INR 1200 per head. If the reporting time is not suiting someone then they can enjoy the day out at their own expenses.  

Schedule for the day out:
Date: Saturday, 3rd June 2023
Reporting Time: 09:30 AM
Venue: Nicco Park (in front of ticket counter)
Schedule: First half is scheduled for Wet-O-Wild and second half is for Nicco Park (after lunch)

Note: Participating members are requested to contact me for Wet-O-Wild rules (Swimming Costume, Towel, Dress Code, Lockers, etc.)

All participating members are requested to reply to this mail as their confirmation of participation along with the names of participating friends or family members by Friday, 19th May 2023. Please feel free to contact me for any further queries.
